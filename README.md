### Objective & General Information
A nucleotide is the basic building block of DNA sequences. The four nucleobases that can appear in a DNA sequence are A,C,G and T. Thus, a DNA sequence is a long chain (string) of nucleotides such as (the following sequence will be referred to it as SQ1)<br />
<br />
                  TTAATTACTCACTGGCTAATTACTCACTGGGTCACTACGCACTG<br />
<br />
In order to construct a DNA sequence of a given DNA, typically the sequence is multiplied and segmented into different lengths. These smaller segments of the DNA undergo a chemical process in order to know the order of nucleotides in each segment. The following sequences are segments of SQ1:<br />
<br />
TTAATTA ATTACTC ACTCAC TCACTGGCTAA CTAATTACTCACTGG CTGGGT GGGTCACT CACTACGCACTG<br />
<br />
These DNA sequences of the smaller segments typically overlap. Thus, they have to be aligned or connected together in order to know the correct sequence. For example, the correct alignment of the previous set of sequences relative to the original DNA sequence is as follows<br />
